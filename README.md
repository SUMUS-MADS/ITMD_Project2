This is the forked shared Repository for Project 2 for the SUMUS-MADS group.

A 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point.

This project we wanted to redesign the layout and overall, and implementing it with a fresh new design. We wanted to limit the contents that we thought as a group weren't needed. My progress to this class has been pretty consistent, and I have been keeping up with the lecture and requirements for the project. 

A 3-4 sentence critique of each group memberâ€™s work on the project.

I feel like for most groups, it's always the communications that keeps us behind from proceeding. However, sicne we all had more than one class we were able to obtain instant communication. Denis and Marco did a good job on doing what they were expected on doing, and Abdullah was basically the team lead here. They all did great work and made sure each other knew their roles.
