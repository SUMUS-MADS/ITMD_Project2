# ITMD_Project2
This is the forked shared Repository for Project 2 for the SUMUS-MADS group.

A 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point.

This project we wanted to redesign the layout and overall, and implementing it with a fresh new design. We wanted to limit the contents that we thought as a group weren't needed. My progress to this class has been pretty consistent, and I have been keeping up with the lecture and requirements for the project. I enjoyed the hands on we had in this class and how in this project, we all had different strengths and weaknessess when it came to HTML, so working together and splitting the work was really cool. I feel like I have gained a lot of how to make a website aesthetically pleasing and powerful. I wish we had covered some PHP stuff and database connection for putting in files. But at this point, I am actually happy of how far I have come and able to successfully design a powerful website. 

A 3-4 sentence critique of each group memberâ€™s work on the project.

I feel like for most groups, it's always the communications that keeps us behind from proceeding. However, since we all had more than one class we were able to obtain instant communication. 

Denis - Good work on implementing media queries on the website and makig sure that the website is readable and useable on certain devices and browsers. He did a good job as a group member. His work has helped the project succeed and didn't leave the team behind. 

Abdullah - It was a pleasure working with him, and he did an excellent job on the overall website's design and layout. He implemented the side bar and its functions, and I loved how it all ended. He did a great job on starting the project and allowing us to assign ourselves some roles to finish the project. 

Marco - Marco did a great job on the add/drop page and making it more visual for the user. I loved how he had made it user friendly and easy to operate. Marco also did a good job on making sure that the CSS flows correctly with the add/drop page. As a group member, what was required out of him was completed.
