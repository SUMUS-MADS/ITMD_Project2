# ITMD_Project2
Self Critique :

This project needed alot of work and attention from the group. Overall as a group we did our parts and were able to handle this project with ease. The class has shown how important Human Interaction is because that was our main goal for this project. To take a website that exist and make a mobile friendly version and redesigning to have a new design was challenging. My progress in this course has been good beause I am now thinking how Human Interaction is for all my projects.
