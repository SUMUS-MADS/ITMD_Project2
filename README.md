# ITMD_Project2
This is Denis Komarov's forked shared Repository for Project 2 for the SUMUS-MADS group.

**My Project & Progress:**

My *Project Two: Web-Portal Redesign* was effective for learning not only
web development, but teamwork. This was my first experience with
creating web pages within a team. The progress was gradual, the rules were new, and it 
is not perfection; there can always be room for improvement. My progress in 
class was prevalent because I achieved greater flexibility between HTML 
structure and CSS design, while also learning behavioral aspects of JavaScript.
Both the project and course proved to be a valuable learning experience.

Group Member Contributions:

My group consists of four people, who all play their own role in the project.
Suhail A., is our group leader and manager of commits and webpage structure.
Hernandez M., is the group behavioralist, who carried out JavaScript responsibility.
Shazard S. is the group structuralist and reviewer; always encouraging the team to 
communicate and stay positive. Komarov, D. is the group architect, who is responsible
for webpage components, layout, and appearance across devices.
